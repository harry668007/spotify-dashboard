LLM Section was originally intended to be a summarizer. I used those metrics as KPI cards at the top of the dashboard instead. So, it will now require excessive context to be able to answer creative questions from user. So, its a work in progress. Subsequent versions will have more functionality, visuals and an LLM that actually answers custom questions. This is just a basic demo for now. The idea with this one was to have a custom user interactive dashboard.
